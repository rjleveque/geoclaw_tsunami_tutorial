# GeoClaw Tsunami Modeling Tutorial

The goal of this tutorial is to lead new users through the use of GeoClaw via
a number of examples, with a focus on tsunami modeling.

This first iteration as a [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/)
is being developed in Autumn 2025,
in particular for our collaborators at the Washington Geological Survey
and in the NSF-funded Cascadia CoPes Hub, and will be evolving to meet these
needs.  It should also be useful to other new users of GeoClaw, and will be
made more generic in the future.
