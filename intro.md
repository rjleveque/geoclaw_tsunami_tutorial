# GeoClaw Tsunami Modeling Tutorial

The goal of this tutorial is to lead new users through the use of GeoClaw via
a number of examples, with a focus on tsunami modeling.

The examples and Jupyter notebooks discussed in the tutorial can all be
obtained via:

    git clone https://github.com/rjleveque/geoclaw_tsunami_tutorial.git

This repository also contains all of the source files used to build
this [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/).

This is a work in progress, being developed for training sessions in
Autumn 2025,
in particular for our collaborators at the [Washington Geological
Survey](https://dnr.wa.gov/washington-geological-survey)
and in the NSF-funded [Cascadia CoPes Hub](https://cascadiacopeshub.org/),
and will be evolving to meet these
needs.  It should also be useful to other new users of GeoClaw, and will be
made more generic in the future.

See [](workflow) for more details on cloning and using this repository.

See [](intro_resources) for links to GeoClaw documentation, videos, and
other existing resources that may be useful in learning to use GeoClaw.
