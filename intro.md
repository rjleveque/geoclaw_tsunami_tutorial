# GeoClaw Tsunami Modeling Tutorial

The goal of this tutorial is to lead new users through the use of GeoClaw via
a number of examples, with a focus on tsunami modeling.

The examples and Jupyter notebooks discussed in the tutorial can all be
obtained via:

    git clone https://github.com/rjleveque/geoclaw_tsunami_tutorial.git

This repository also contains all of the source files used to build
this [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/).

This is a work in progress, being developed for training sessions in
Autumn 2025,
in particular for our collaborators at the Washington Geological Survey
and in the NSF-funded Cascadia CoPes Hub, and will be evolving to meet these
needs.  It should also be useful to other new users of GeoClaw, and will be
made more generic in the future.

See [](workflow) for more details on cloning and using this repository.
