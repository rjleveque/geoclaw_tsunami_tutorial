    "\n",
    "Creates an fgmax grid for `point_style==4` in GeoClaw covering the points around Copalis Beach that are below some specified elevation.  Instead of specifying a regular 2D grid and monitoring fgmax values at every point on the grid (as was done in [](copalis_example2)), a file is created in the format of a topofile that has 0/1 values at each grid point indicating whether fgmax values should be monitored at that point or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example we start with a desired fgmax region that extends farther north than the fgmax grid used in [](copalis_example2), so that it contains many points in the hills north of town that are so high we know in advance that the tsunami will not reach them, and hence it would be a waste of effort to monitor them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example we go down to 1/3 arcsecond resolution on the finest grid and specify the fgmax points by starting with the topo file `$GTT/topo/topofiles/Copalis_13s.asc` at this resolution, cropped to the desired `fgmax_extent = [-124.2, -124.155, 47.11, 47.18]`. The cropped DEM is 756 x 486 and contains 367416 points. By selecting only the points that have elevation less than 30 m (relative to MHW), we can reduce this to only 284092 fgmax points.  These numbers are calculated below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that what elevation we should choose as our cutoff will depend on the event(s) we plan to model and the nature of the topography.  Large near-field events will typically inundate to higher elevations than small events or far-field tsunamis. Steep canyons near the coast may focus waves and can experience inundation to much greater elevations than would be seen on a gentle coastal plane.  Some experimentation may be needed in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results shown in the [](fgmax_results) notebook indicate that for the problem being solved here, the elevation of 30m is **not** sufficient if one is interested in capturing the highest inundation values in some narrow canyons to the north of Copalis Beach, or on the high bluffs along the river.  However, if the goal is to model inunduation only in regions around the town, then this is sufficient and in fact a smaller cutoff value (and perhaps smaller fgmax region) would be sufficient.\n",
