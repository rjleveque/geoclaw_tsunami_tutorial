# Copalis Beach example3

From the
[GeoClaw Tsunami Tutorial](https://rjleveque.github.io/geoclaw_tsunami_tutorial)

See [](../README) for more about the Copalis Beach location and a
list of other examples and tutorials based on this location.

The directory `$GTT/CopalisBeach/example3` will
contain an example of a far-field tsunami, by specifying hypothetical
source in Alaska (the AKmaxWA event used for WA state hazard maps?).

See [](../README) for more about the Copalis Beach location and a
list of other examples and tutorials based on this location.

## Contents (Work in Progress):

Plan to illustrate...

- Larger domain and appropriate grid resolutions for long-distance
  propagation,
- Using flagregions to guide AMR, including RuledRectangles that cover
  the continental shelf, as created in the notebook
  [Make Flagregions along the Coast](https://www.clawpack.org/gallery/_static/apps/notebooks/geoclaw/MakeFlagregionsCoast.html)

:::{warning}
As in [](../example1/README), these examples are not intended to be modified,
and notebooks illustraing postprocessing results will use a
`fetch_sample_results.py` script to get the expected output directories.

See [](workflow:copy) if you want to modify the examples and run them yourself.
