# Copalis Beach example2

From the
[GeoClaw Tsunami Tutorial](https://rjleveque.github.io/geoclaw_tsunami_tutorial)

See [](../README) for more about the Copalis Beach location and a
list of other examples and tutorials based on this location.

The directory `$GTT/CopalisBeach/example2`
contains more complicated GeoClaw `setrun` and `setplot` functions to 
illustrate many of the things listed in [](../../../intro_setrun) and
[](../../../intro_postproc).

See [](../README) for more about the Copalis Beach location and a
list of other examples and tutorials based on this location.

## Contents (Work in Progress):

Plan to illustrate...

- Adding fgmax grids, plotting results on map or satellite image
- Adding fgout grids, creating animations
- Fancier gauge plots
- Etc.

:::{warning}
As in [](../example1/README), these examples are not intended to be modified,
and notebooks illustraing postprocessing results will use a
`fetch_sample_results.py` script to get the expected output directories.

See [](workflow:copy) if you want to modify the examples and run them yourself.
