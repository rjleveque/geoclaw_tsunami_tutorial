# Interactive fgmax results

From the
[GeoClaw Tsunami Tutorial](https://rjleveque.github.io/geoclaw_tsunami_tutorial)

The directory `$GTT/CopalisBeach/example2`
contains a GeoClaw example that produces results on fgout and fgmax grids.
The map below goes with the discussion of [](fgmax_results).

The folium map created by the notebook
[](plot_fgmax) is saved there as an html file that can be posted on
the web for any viewer to interact with, or embedded in a webpage as is done
here.

Note that you can turn off the fgmax layer in the menu in the top
right corner to better see the underlying map.
