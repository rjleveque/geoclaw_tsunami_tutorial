    "Note that the piecewise constant solution seems to show unequal cell sizes and the topography appears to have some very narrow spikes that do not show up in the linear version. That is because the transect chosen is at an angle to the grid and cuts through the middle of some cells but only nicks a corner of other cells.  Since 1000 points are used along the transect, it has much higher resolution than the underlying computational cells, and so there may be one or transect points in a cell even if the transect barely touches it.  Bilinear interpolation between the 4 neighboring cell centers gives a much smoother interpolant."
