# CopalisBeach examples

The directory `$CLAW/apps/tsunami-examples/tutorials/GeoClawTutorial1/CopalisBeach`
contains some example simulations of tsunamis inundating the coastal region
around [Copalis Beach, WA (-124.1733, 47.1134)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RW275B5TzY4oQakaA) as shown in the image below:

This region was chosen as a relatively small-scale example of interesting
coastal topography.  Moreover it is historically important in our understanding
of past CSZ tsunamis.  The
[ghost forest](https://wa100.dnr.wa.gov/willapa-hills/copalis-ghost-forest)
indicated in the satellite image above contains trees that were rapidly
killed by saltwater intrusion following coseismic coastal subsidence during
the earthquake of January 26, 1700, the last major CSZ event.
