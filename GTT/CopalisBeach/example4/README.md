# Copalis Beach example4

From the
[GeoClaw Tsunami Tutorial](https://rjleveque.github.io/geoclaw_tsunami_tutorial)

See [](../README) for more about the Copalis Beach location and a
list of other examples and tutorials based on this location.

The directory `$GTT/CopalisBeach/example4` will
contain an example of a far-field tsunami, by specifying an inverted
source for the 2025 Kamchatka event (?).

See [](../README) for more about the Copalis Beach location and a
list of other examples and tutorials based on this location.

## Contents (Work in Progress):

Plan to illustrate...

- Domain that spans the date line and the need for care in specifying
  topo and dtopo files, gauge locations, etc. in longitude E or W.
- An event with little inundation (will this be sufficiently interesting?)

:::{warning}
As in [](../example1/README), these examples are not intended to be modified,
and notebooks illustraing postprocessing results will use a
`fetch_sample_results.py` script to get the expected output directories.

See [](workflow:copy) if you want to modify the examples and run them yourself.
