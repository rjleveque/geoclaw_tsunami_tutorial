(topodir)=
# topo directory

The `geoclaw_tsunami_tutorial/GTT/topo` directory contains scripts and
notebooks that download or create topo files.

- `fetch_topo1.py`
- `CopalisTopo.ipynb` which renders in the tutorial as [](CopalisTopo)
- `fetch_etopo22.ipynb` which renders in the tutorial as [](fetch_etopo22)

The subdirectory `topo/topofiles` contains the actual topofiles that are
used as GeoClaw input in various examples.
