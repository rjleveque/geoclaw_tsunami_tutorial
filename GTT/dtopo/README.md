# dtopo directory

The `geoclaw_tsunami_tutorial/GTT/dtopo` directory contains scripts and
notebooks that download or create dtopo files.

- `ASCE_SIFT_Region2.ipynb` creates the dtopo file.
  which renders in the tutorial as [](ASCE_SIFT_Region2).

- `fetch_ASCE_SIFT_Region2.py` downloads the dtopo file from the remote data repository.

The subdirectory `dtopo/dtopofiles` contains the actual dtopofiles that are
used as GeoClaw input in various examples.
