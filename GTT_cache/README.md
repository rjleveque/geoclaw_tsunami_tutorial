# GTT_cache directory

This directory is used to cache large data files that are only downloaded if
you need them for running GeoClaw examples or Jupyter notebooks.

The notebook [](../GTT/CopalisBeach/example1/fetch_sample_results) shows an
example of how to download sample results.

The contents of this directory can be safely removed to eliminate some large
files.

Data files are managed using the 
[pooch software](https://www.fatiando.org/pooch/latest/index.html).
